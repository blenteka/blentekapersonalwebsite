    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Blen Teka, which is not a name you hear often. That is most probably because I am from a special region in Ethiopia called Tigray. I am a proud Tigrawiti. I spent the first few years of my life there before being thrown into a new world at the age of 7 when my family and I moved to one of most well known cities in the US, Las Vegas. Now, fastforward, and here I am, going into my junior year of highschool more than ready to take on the world. I plan to attend Oregon State Univerity as a Computer Science major and get my masters. Then I will continue to secure a stable and desirable job as a software engineer. From there I will use my extended knowlege from my masters degree and cumilated knowlege from my years as a software engineer to become an AI Engineer. Along the way I hope to make unforgetable relationships with a plethora of people, travel the world, and create a good time.</p>
